This repository compiles my Docker studies from a number of different sources: coursera/udemy/free-data-camp courses, along with myriad tutorials.

__*but why?*__
* It follows that from a traditional data analysis learning path comes a point where data engineering skills become not only useful, but necessary: as the different steps of data manipulation morph into an ETL process, the pipeline emerges. This pipeline _will_ leak, bugs _will_ crawl inside, and now we need tools to make sure that the ~~spice~~ data flows smoothly.

__*but how?*__
* With a number of different tools. But in particular, on the subject of infrastructure, with Docker and containerization.
